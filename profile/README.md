# Oh hey there, we're Moose!
Moose Interactive was founded in December of 2024, but we've been making Minecraft servers way before then! We're a team of experienced people who like to have a laugh and make memories. 

## A little bit more about us.
We're passionate about making experiences on Minecraft - and we can do that through the power of our servers. 

## People behind Moose Interactive.
